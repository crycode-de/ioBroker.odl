  "info_text": "The ODL measuring network of the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz, BfS) monitor the natural radiation exposure using about 1700 ODL measuring stations. The intensity of the local dose rate is sometimes affected by external factors. These include rain, snow and wind. Maintenance work, reconstruction of the site, malfunctions of transmitters, malfunctions of probes and regular radiological testing of the probes may lead to a short-term or long-term downtime of measuring stations."
